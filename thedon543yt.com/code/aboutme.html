      <p style="text-align: center;  font-size: x-large; color: white;">Yo yo yo what is going on guys it is THEdon543 here. I wanted to create this website and kickstart my business as a Call of Duty content creator. My love for dropping nukes and playing with friends urged me to start creating my content and
      ultimately this space. It means a lot to have built a fan base and cannot thank you guys enough. Remember that each and every one of you are members of the Don Squad and we've all been working together to rise this channel to the top! With all of your help, my team and I (all pictured below) hope to continue growing this business and spread positivity in Call of Duty lobbies. Feel free to check out the merchandise and make sure you head over to the YouTube channel if you haven't already! But for now I'm outta here man, peace, enjoy the gameplay y'all ;).</p>

            </h1>
            <p style="text-align: left; color: white;">
               If you've followed the channel for a while you know this gem already. Alyza has even been featured in
               multiple videos
               where she displays that she is both the true master of Shipment <a

               <br>
               <br>
               All jokes aside Alyza has been a crucial member of the team from the beginning. It's hard to imagine the
               channel
               being
               as successful as it's been without her. She always has some new cool video ideas for me to try out and is
               always
               willing
               to help me and be a part of anything I need on the channel. But aside from that, it's hard to describe how
               grateful I
               am
               for her constant love and support - whenever things seem to be going the wrong way, she's always there to
               show me why
               they're actually looking up. Her spirit is the very essence of the atmosphere and community we're trying to
               create on
               this channel, and everyday she makes me want to be a better person and creator. Love you baby.

            <p style="color: white; text-align: left; ">
               Ah yes, a man who needs no introduction - it's the one, the only, bostonboy3397. My cousin Devin is without a doubt
               the
               most featured player on the channel besides myself. We've been dropping kids off for years now, and we don't plan on
               stopping anytime soon! I just one day hope to be able to say I've dropped as many nukes as Devin has died to Bouncing
               Betties - it's a tall task I know ;).
               <br>
               <br>
               To be honest though, most of what you are seeing here was inspired and created by Devin himself. While he's not much
               good at avoiding those Proximity Mines, he's studying at the Kelley School of Business in Indiana, and has been
               invaluable in helping create this site and get the business off the ground moving forward. Can't thank you enough
               fam.
