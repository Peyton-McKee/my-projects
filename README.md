# my-projects
A repository containing the projects I've worked on both in class and on my own.

Checkers is a python project that I created in Processing 2 for my AP Computer Science Performance Exam. This was the first time I really decided to explore the capababilities of processing and went outside the curriculum to understand more complex data structures within python. The first time I created a checkers game was in an intro to C++ class and was forced to use entirely text(emojis) to complete it so this project definitely felt more concrete and polished than my previous attempt. 

Ski Mountain Finder is a Swift coded app made in X-Code for my IOS Programming class in the fall of 2021. I felt particularly proud of how much I accomplished in a short 1 1/2 months of working on it and although the webscraping doesn't work very well, it was the attempt that encouraged me to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript

thedon543yt.com is a website I made for my brother in Visual Studio Code outside of any class room perspective. I'm very proud of the ways that I communicated inbetween web pages for never having taken a course on HTML or web development in the first place. Learning how to work with Paypal's payment system on my own was also a great experience and a way to see professional coding on a small scale. 

Facebook question is a xcode project that I coded to answer an interview question posed by facebook that I saw. It was awesome to see that the skills I had learned during my class could be used to answer a problem outside of the classroom. 

checkers.cpp is the c++ final I created in 2018 as my first attempt to make checkers. Unfortunately variables outside of the primitive scope were not covered in the class so I was forced to imporvise by using emojis represented by chars and integers on the ascii table to create the board and pieces. While very user unfriendly, I think, with the limitations I had, it was an impressive feat that I accomplished very early into my computer science career.
