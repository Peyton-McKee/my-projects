# my-projects
A repository containing the projects I've worked on both in class and outside of class

Ski Mountain Finder is a Swift coded app made in X-Code for my IOS Programming class in the fall of 2021. 
I felt particularly proud of how much I accomplished in a short 1 1/2 months of working on it and although the webscraping doesn't work very well,
it was the attempt that encouraged me to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript

thedon543yt.com is a website I made for my brother in Visual Studio Code outside of any class room perspective. I'm very proud of the ways that I communicated inbetween web pages for never having taken a course on HTML or web development in the first place. Learning how to work with Paypal's payment system on my own was also a great experience and a way to see professional coding on a small scale.
